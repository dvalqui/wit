For my final project wih Codeclan, I wanted to create something meaningful and helpful for women in tech. I began thinking about the pioneers in the STEM fields and realized how lovely it would be to have a page devoted to them. So in the span of aboutsix days, I built a demo project called Important Women in Tech History. I created the backend using Java and Spring. I did some research and decided on three women to start with, since there was a lot of information to go through for each. Using Spring dependencies I generated individual ids for each woman on my list and decided what information to include. That was hard because there were so manny interesting facts! I settled on, in addition to their names of course, their dates of birth (and death if applicable), a short bio, any agencies or institutions they worked for, and publications. The publications ended up being a separate entity because the list could get quite long. 
My full vision for this project is much bigger. I want the option to request additions to lists, have short videos about the women that are available free to the public, a blog, and a resource page (which I actually did add). I will continue to work on this project because it is a passion of mine.
